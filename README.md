# godot-3d-runner-controller
Code snippets and ideas to use for a 3d runner/fps controller in godot. Is a mini-demo itself.

# features
Walking, sprinting, jumping, crouching, climbing.

The test level has a few layers to it - the upper is very basic, one down is with crouch testing and more climbing obstacles, third one is a bit about slopes.

# what's under the hood
Raycasts and state-machine sort of logic. Nothing special, just just like a notebook of snippets to use.
