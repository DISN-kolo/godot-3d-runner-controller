# godot-3d-runner-controller
Code snippets and ideas to use for a 3d runner/fps controller in godot. Is a 
mini-demo itself.

Made and tested on v4.1 stable for linux x86\_64.

## features
Walking [WASD], sprinting [Shift], jumping [Space. There's even some grace time!], 
crouching [Ctrl], climbing [Space. See an icon appear in the top left corner to 
indicate the possibility to climb]. There's even zoom [Alt]! Also: head-bobbing, 
speed-based FOV, HAAAAANDS with animation (note: I'm very much ***NOT*** an animator)

The test level is a small obstacle course with moving and rotating platforms.

## what's under the hood
Raycasts and state-machine sort of logic, animation player and tree. Nothing special, just just like a 
notebook of snippets to use. *Or maybe... one day... who knows?..*
